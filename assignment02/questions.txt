Please write your answers in a file called "answers.txt" with your names
at the top in this repository. Please number each answer.

1. What is the tightest bound Big-O runtime of randomIntArray()?
Please explain your answer (succinctly).

2. What is the tightest bound Big-O runtime of arraySearchSpeed()?
Please explain your answer (succinctly).

3. In the worst case how many searches do you need to do to make it worthwhile
to sort an array to use binary search instead of just using linear search
if the array has 10,000 elements and is originally unsorted. Assume
that every search will fail to find the sought element. Assume that linear
search takes 5 instructions for each element considered and binary search takes
 10. Assume that every instruction takes the same amount of time. Assume that
the sorting algorithm takes 12 * N * log(N) instructions to complete. Your 
final answer just needs to be a single number, but show your work (math).

4. The function arraySearchSpeed() returns a pair. List three alternative C++
constructs that could have been used instead of pair as the return type.
