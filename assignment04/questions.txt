3. What property does a custom class need to have for it to be usable in an array with the three sort methods you implemented? Give a name to the concept and also explain specifically in C++ what would need to be implemented.

4. Why is std::sort so much faster than any of our implementations? Is it primarily because it is better optimized, or is it something more fundamental?
